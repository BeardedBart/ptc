# Propeller Thrust Calculator

It is an app that calculates thrust of a propeller (static and dynamic) of various diameter and pitch.

## Formula

## Input data
Config file takes input for the program.
Important informations:
- if "units" is equal to 1, the units are SI units, if 0 - Imperial units
- "revolutions" parameter is reffered to revolutions of propeller, not rpm of engine (rpm of prop in RC planes is reduced by the drag of propeller and the max power of motor)
## Output

## WIP:
- calculating static thrust;
- returning a csv file with thrust correlated with speed of an aircraft;
